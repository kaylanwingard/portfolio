        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <h3>Hi. I'm Kaylan Wingard. Let's talk design.</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I’m a Las Vegas-based UX designer with a love for stories and
            user-first interfaces.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I ever touched design, I got my degree in political science
            (I know, I know). Turns out I liked numbers and details, and most of
            what that degree taught me is that almost all avenues of public
            communication between the government and public were outdated. That
            included the user experience, which is often anything but
            user-friendly. From there, I began to see bad design everywhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            But as it turns out, when you spend your whole life going “this app
            feels bad”, you can actually ask why. You can even push pixels about
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a background in health technology now and personal investment
            in it as a late-onset type 1 diabetic. All of this means that I like
            caring about people, and I like seeing tangible change via design. I
            also love the 8pt grid.
          </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I’m a published tabletop roleplaying game writer (think Dungeons and
            Dragons, but more independent than that—ask me about it if you want
            to know!) and I spend a lot of time coding for fun (ask me less
            about this, because it’s slightly embarrassing that I open documents
            called styles.css as a hobby). I also avidly crochet.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is built out of a plethora of HTML and CSS, as well as the
            tiniest touch of JavaScript. Turns out React components aren’t
            really necessary for a portfolio site.
