                    Making health care into local politics.
                   </h3>
                   <p>
                    The political can be personal — especially if you have a health
                    concern that makes it more relevant to you than the average person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most people in the U.S. focus on national health laws. However,
                    local health laws, such as state expansions of low-income health
                    care options like Medicaid, can be just as if not more important to
                    the average person. In my time studying political science, I saw
                    just how lacking easily accessible information was to most people —
                    and to me, someone with a degree in the topic!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this last project in the Coursera Google UX course, I decided to
                    focus on health legislation and how to make it more accessible to
                    the average person.

            Most complicated political topics—namely health bills—aren’t
          understandable to an everyday audience, including those who are most
          directly affected. Those who do understand are often unsure of what
          actions to take next. Billcheck’s goal is to make U.S. citizens new
          and old capable of finding health legislation quick, efficient, and
          relevant to them while also offering ideas for next steps.

        <h2 align="center">Objectives & Research</h2>
        <h3>User Surveys</h3>
        <p>
          I recruited a group of ten different individuals with ages ranging from
          20 to 60. There was a range of political activism in the group, and only
          two of the individuals worked with health care or in a field relating to
          public health. From my interviews I discovered three main pain points.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Confusion on terms:</b> Most political topics are couched in formal
            and legal language that may be misleading. Adding medical topics into
            that create an even more severe barrier. Users expressed confusion
            about what terms might mean and often wished for simple and clear
            language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Difficulty finding relevant bills or laws:</b> Users with different
            health needs wanted to see bills relevant to their needs, not just
            every bill related to health care in general. A few older individuals
            complained about having a hard time navigating their local
            government’s website. In other words, they wanted specificity over
            generalized content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>No prompts for next actions:</b> Calls to action are deeply
            important to political activism. Users indicated that they could
            gather that information through news sources, but didn’t know what to
            do with it afterwards, and often felt like they would lose track of a
            bill.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most of these indicated confusion while trying to understand and
          categorize information, not issues with finding information in and of
          itself, as well as what to do afterwards.
        </p>
        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Running a competitive audit was surprisingly difficult. There were very
          few competitors to what I wanted to make, especially with a health
          focus, but I managed to find a few that were more website-based, as well
          as one app (Causes). There were a few gaps in the market that I
          immediately noticed. To illustrate these I’ll be using Bill Track 50, a
          website which includes local legislation, and Causes, a platform which
          combines social media and political knowledge.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Interfaces were often archaic and difficult to read.</b> Bill Check
            50 has, without a doubt, one of the better interfaces, but the main
            feature screen appears to be set up more for something like a tablet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Most apps were full of information, but designed for experienced
              political activists or those with pre-existing strong political
              interest.</b
            >
            Bill Check 50’s Bill Search feature requires you to search certain
            terms. I tried some common health vocabulary, and I was clearly
            searching the wrong thing. No results at all. This is difficult for
            someone new to political topics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Those that were more user-focused often had a social media leaning
              and included how to contact your representative, but not as much
              info beyond that.</b
            >
            Calls to action are deeply important to political activism. Users
            indicated that they could gather that information through news
            sources, but didn’t know what to do with it afterwards, and often felt
            like they would lose track of a bill.

        <h3>Personas & User Journey</h3>
        <img src="/images/health/persona.png" />
        <img src="/images/health/journey.png" />
        <p>
          The user journey helped me identify a few specific places where
          improvements could be made, especially while considering the previous
          pain points.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A glossary or simple language definitions built into the app</li>

            topics

            A way to track a particular bill’s path through a local legislature

        <div class="imagegrid three">

        <h3>Lo-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <img src="/images/health/protomap.png" />
        <p>
          I wanted to experiment with a few things I hadn’t used before: topbar
          tab menus, as well as an emphasis on cards with text and images
          involved. I also wanted to make sure that people had next steps
          involved, so I created an achievements section.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here, I began animating. The most complex part of this was actually
          making sure every single topbar connected appropriately. Although this
          seemed easy, and was by the end, it took more care than I anticipated.
        </p>
        <p align="center" style="margin: 40px 0">
          <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/proto/v3sB8TR7Sx9aVm4PlG9Lrn/Local-Health-Bill-App?page-id=100%3A648&node-id=100%3A1243&viewport=-620%2C709%2C0.5&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=100%3A1243"

          I conducted five usability tests with multiple individuals. These were
          moderated remote usability studies. They attempted to complete the
          onboarding process, find bills, and look at the achievements page.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Topbar height. Most users had some trouble with the height of the
            topbar, complaining about the height of it making it more difficult to
            touch. This is an enormous amount of lost functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Swipe navigation. Most users intuitively saw the topbar tabs as a sign
            of swipe functions (such as with Instagram or Dribbble), and became
            frustrated when attempting to use a function that did not exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clearer indicators (text, colors, icons). Most users were confused by
            indicators of certain links (i.e. definitions in bill descriptions)
            and which achievements were complete or not.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <img src="/images/health/styleguide.png" />
        <p>
          My past work had involved color or dark mode. I wanted to emphasize
          something clean and easy to understand, so I picked two complimentary
          colors of blue and orange. The blue was more soothing and seemed
          friendlier, while the orange was a sharp accent that, to me, created
          feelings of action and activity. I decided to use Space Grotesk for my
          headlines and IBM Plex Sans for my body. These were easily available
          fonts from Google. Space Grotesk, to me, looked modern and almost
          slightly playful with its mix of sharp corners and curves, while IBM
          Plex Sans was easily readable on screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made sure to avoid flat white and flat black (#FFF and #000
          respectively) for my background and text, as my web design history had
          taught me that these could sometimes be jarring in certain environments
          when placed on top of each other.I conducted five usability tests with
          multiple individuals. These were moderated remote usability studies.
          They attempted to complete the onboarding process, find bills, and look
          at the achievements page.

        </div>
        <p>
          Here, I ran into some of the issues with Figma. Figma’s smart animate
          feature is great, but sometimes it picks up on the wrong things. I had
          to compromise on some of the animations in order to get what I wanted
          done with the swiping.I also decided to decrease the amount of orange
          even more, in order to keep it from overwhelming the rest of the
          prototype. I integrated animations on onboarding and animations on the
          home page to make it feel more dynamic and alive, but in text and
          information-heavy pages, I used less animation to keep from distracting
          the user.

          <h1>Results & Reflections</h1>
          <p>
            This project taught me a lot about some of Figma's limitations. I ran
            into issues with its implementation of something I’d done before in
            web design: sticky topbars. I hypothetically wanted to be able to
            create more sticky elements on scroll, but Figma wasn’t friendly
            towards this idea. I also learned just how much a style guide can make
            creation easier.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Card design is something that is useful to categorize and, in a way,
            herd in information. Grouping is a powerful tool in UX, and I came to
            realize just how important it could be as I began to both distinguish
            between certain sections and repeat designs in other sections to
            associate them.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            What I wanted was an app that was personalized towards health
            legislation, relevant to an area, and friendly rather than archaic. I
            believe I succeeded in this regard, and I’m proud of the work I did.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Given more time and a budget, I would complete further usability
            tests, and I would build in more features such as a glossary. For this
            project I decided to limit myself to the core functions needed from
            the initial problem statements: definitions, relevant legislation, and
            calls to action. However, I believe this could be expanded without
            harming the focus of Billcheck.
