                  <p>
                    It’s basically a running joke: the hardest thing isn’t learning the
                    game but pulling three to six functioning adults into a Zoom call
                    or, even more sparingly, in person in order to play it.

                    SessionZero was born from that impulse: how do we make scheduling
                    easier and reduce the cognitive load on a group starting out but
                    finding themselves bouncing from Google Calendar to Zoom to a
                    notekeeping app to virtual tabletop platforms or an in-person table?

            Create an app for tabletop game players that provides quick scheduling
            as well as reminders for all players in a group, and that streamlines
            and organizes the process of forming a group or beginning a new game
            with an existing group. This app should facilitate communication and
            communication.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
  
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/persona1.png" />
        <p>
          Those engaging with TTRPGs can generally be divided into two
          groups: players, and game masters (GMs). Though these two groups are
          both engaged with the game, GMs generally have more management-focused
          concerns, while players interact with the game on a more general level
          guided by a game master. From interviews and surveys, I managed to
          synthesize three main pain points.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unresponsive players or GMs: Both sides often invest a particularly
            large amount of time into games. However, when one person disappears
            off the face of the planet or otherwise is unresponsive, it can make
            the other participants feel unwanted and eventually detached from the
            whole game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Last minute cancellations: This was unsurprising to basically anyone
            involved. Scheduling conflicts are, as you will often see, the
            absolute bane of any group. Rescheduling, conflicts, and last minute
            cancellations are all common.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organizing multiple games: GMs are especially likely to play multiple
            games at once—and even play and run multiple games at once. Imagine
            having different games, maybe even technically using the same system,
            all overlapping in different weekly, biweekly, or monthly schedules.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/venn.png" />
        <p>
          The pain points experienced here are mostly all based around
          facilitating communication and scheduling. Although I had other features
          in mind, I knew that I'd have to begin with those core parts of the
          experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <img src="images/ttrpg/audit.png" />
        <p>
          Running a competitive audit was fairly easy. I began by researching apps
          used by others to schedule out their games and ran a general feature
          comparison to start. I looked at Doodle, a common scheduling app, the
          classic Google Calendar, and RollRota, a website designed for a similar
          niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that RollRota had the most robust set of core systems, but was
          very focused on scheduling. From speaking to some players, I knew that
          the initial starting experience often involved a lot of steps,
          especially for some of the more private and difficult parts of creating
          a campaign. Being able to propose times also would help run games,
          especially if several players canceled and someone needed to check in
          with them.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">Design & Refinement</h2>
        <h3>Lo-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/lofi.png" />
        <p>
          I began building out prototypes, beginning with the home page. It went
          through multiple iterations as we decided what information was best to
          include. Once I had a solid design for the home screen, the rest of the
          app began to develop around that. I decided to go for a sleek, modern,
          easy to understand design. Dark mode felt like it would be friendlier on
          the eyes, and I wanted it to feel somewhat like Discord, a popular
          messaging app used by most TTRPG groups.
        </p>
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/palette.png" />
        <p>
          The first thing I did was decide to sit down and pick a purple as the
          app's main accent color. Purple has "imaginative" connotations that, and
          I wanted to enforce that, as well as a relatively neutral emotional
          palette. I had already settled on a sleek dark mode look to modernize a
          little, so I pulled a few tints and shades of that purple for the main
          color.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also knew that color would be vitally important to distinguish most
          groups at a glance, so I gathered a variety of saturated accent colors
          that would stand up well against the brand purple and dark background.
          With dark mode, I knew that transparency would also be useful in
          creating elevation with lesser impact from drop shadows, so I prepared a
          few surface colors with different opacity.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/typography.png" />
        <p>
          Fonts play a huge part in distinguishing the look and feel of an app. I
          had a few objectives: I didn't want a font that was too "fantasy" or
          "sci-fi", as this often pigeonholes the look of many TTRPG products. At
          the same time, I wanted a warmer, friendlier feel than a clinical
          sans-serif font. I gathered a variety of fonts, including those that
          leaned more into fantasy or sci-fi, wrote some dummy copy, and showed
          the selection to different users in my age group to see what keywords or
          feelings they got from the mix of terms and fonts. I eventually decided
          on Nunito Sans for a rounded, friendly look that wasn't particularly
          connected with any genre.
        </p>
        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <img src="/images/ttrpg/hifi.png" />
        <p>
          Now that I had an official style guide done, I could move into the hi-fi
          prototyping stage. I wanted the app to feel cohesive and whole, but for
          each group to have its own space. Using individualized colors at a
          glance would help with this feeling of individual spaces (unless, of
          course, someone changed the group color—though there's not much to be
          done about that).
        </p>

        </p>
          <img src="/images/ttrpg/process.png" />
        <p>One of the most interesting parts of the design for me was making sure to design with accessibility in mind. This is even more of a challenge with dark mode. In building out these screens, however, we also began to deviate from the initial wireframes in order to increase accessibility.. For example, by adding text to icons and double checking sizes of interactable elements, we realized that we'd have to deviate somewhat to ensure touch targets and other elements were accessible. </p>

          <h1>Results & Reflections</h1>
          <p>
            This project, to me, emphasized the complexity of a larger app. Error states were everywhere—what if something changed? What if a group left the intended flow of notification, session, and then debrief? This was a project about balancing: about balancing feasibility with dreaming, about acknowledging other tools in conjunction with what was being built, and knowing the limits of what users would actually work with. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Repeating language throughout the app is both better for developers (for example, recycling the session screen date picker with the one used when you schedule a new session) and helps a new user learn how to navigate the app. The more we can repeat elements in ways that make sense, without compromising the meaning and integrity of the component, the more we can educate the user. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
           I'd love to go back and build out light mode completely. This would further expand the color library in ways that would be challenging and interesting, and might necessitate a new set of shades and tints for accent colors. Although I don't think SessionZero can ever do everything—there's no reason to make it into a virtual tabletop, for example—I'd love to add features specifically for paid game masters and other systems that facilitate play more easily. I'd also love to further refine the calender experience to link up with other calendar services, to further detect overlaps and conflicts. The time zone calculator and the ranked choice selectors are very useful for groups. Compromise is the name of the game, and this facilitates it.
