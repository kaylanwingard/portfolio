                 <h3>
                    Helping pets find their forever home.
                   </h3>
                   <p>
                    In Southern Nevada last year, over 1,000 pets were adopted out to
                    various homes. More often than ever, pets have to unfortunately be
                    given to local shelters and then rehomed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this project, I decided to do something different. Rather than
                    conjuring up imaginary users, I decided to think locally and look at
                    the website for the Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
                    Animals (NSPCA).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their website was older and needed some updating—and specifically,
                    the user adoption search page was, at the time, completely broken.
                  </p>

            <h1 align="center">The Challenge</h1>
            Many local pet shelter websites cannot compete with more modern
          interfaces, UX and UI, and web design in general. The goal is to
          update a local shelter website to be easier to navigate with filtering
          options, a more cohesive design, and a friendlier interface. By
          streamlining the process and making it more user friendly, adoptionsi
          would be quicker and easier for both the NSPCA and those looking to
          adopt pets.

        <h2 align="center">Objectives & Research</h2>
        <h3>User Surveys</h3>
        <p>
          I recruited a series of people interested in pets — several current pet
          owners and several who had not owned pets before. I kept the age ranges
          and gender identities wide, including a mix of people from 20 to 60.
          Interviews lasted about thirty minutes as I asked them about the process
          of adopting a pet.I made sure to reinforce that, for most shelters, you
          might place interest online, but most places would still require you to
          attend in person.From my interviews I discovered two main pain points.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Find pets with the right qualities:</b> Most users might generally
            want a certain kind of pet — a type, a size, maybe a particular age
            range. This lends itself towards filters as well as a way to show
            similar pets rather than forcing people to return
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Seeing pets similar to a chosen option:</b> Once a user had found a
            pet they liked, they often wanted to see other similar pets to be able
            to compare rather than searching again or just scrolling through an
            often overwhelming amount of results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most of these indicated confusion while trying to understand and
          categorize information, not issues with finding information in and of
          itself, as well as what to do afterwards.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona Creation</h3>
        <img src="/images/shelter/persona.png" />
        <p>
          In order to focus on what users wanted, I decided to create a user
          persona for this site. In the pursuit of modernizing a website, I
          decided I wanted to focus on a younger audience. There are many reasons
          to adopt a pet, but it’s often for the sake of companionship. Moreover,
          I knew that many would-be adoptees had particular problems that they
          needed solved, such as apartment regulations or particular health needs.
        </p>
        <h3>Site Map</h3>
        <img src="/images/shelter/sitemap.png" />
        <p>
          To create a site map, I looked through several other adoption websites
          to see the most important shared pages. In general, information was in a
          few broad categories: adoptions, volunteer opportunities, donations and
          other support, community assistance, and more about the organization.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">Design & Refinement</h2>
        <h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>
        <img src="/images/shelter/paper.png" />
        <p>
          To me, the home page needed to be significantly different from what it
          was. In my head, I had a few different sections: a header, an about
          section of some kind, a featured pets section, and an calendar with
          upcoming events (as adoption events are fairly popular). I also knew
          that a topbar and a footer would be standard options to organize the
          website, which gave me two other options to design around.
        </p>
        <h3>Digital Wireframes</h3>
        <div class="imagegrid two">
          <img src="/images/shelter/lofi1.png" />
          <img src="/images/shelter/lofi2.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Designing digital wireframes for this site helped solidify several
          design choices. The consistency of buttons would be important to make
          the site feel cohesive. I also realized that this was going to involve
          several different kinds and shapes of cards on the search page, the home
          page, and the similar pets section I had decided to add earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The footer took the most time to design. It’s difficult to organize a
          footer that doesn’t feel overwhelming but that does feel like it has all
          the needed information. I wanted to emphasize the shelter’s address and
          phone number as the most relevant forms of contact.
        </p>
        <h3>Lo-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <img src="/images/shelter/protomap.png" />
        <p>
          From here, I moved into early low-fidelity prototype stages. Thankfully,
          this website for an adoption flow did not need to be that complicated. I
          decided to keep it down to a search with filtering options, pets’ pages,
          and a simple form. Most shelters would ask prospective forever homes to
          meet the pet before simply adopting them out. I decided it was most
          important to let the shelter be able to contact the home, so the form
          would require basic contact details and a confirmation that those
          details were received.
        </p>
        <p align="center" style="margin: 40px 0">
          <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/proto/v3sB8TR7Sx9aVm4PlG9Lrn/Local-Health-Bill-App?page-id=100%3A648&node-id=100%3A1243&viewport=-620%2C709%2C0.5&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=100%3A1243"
            >View Prototype</a
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted four usability tests with multiple individuals. These were
          moderated remote usability studies for convenience’s sake. They
          attempted to find their way to a pet's search page and then complete the
          adoption flow.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Confusing confirmation page. Users mentioned that the confirmation
            page felt confusing in comparison to prior pages, as if the design had
            switched. This was changed to be more cohesive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple ways to reach the search page. Most users who, on instinct,
            scrolled past the topbar and into the rest of the home page disliked
            having to scroll back up in order to find the relevant page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <img src="/images/shelter/hifi.png" />
        <p>
          The most important part of the high-fidelity prototype here for me was
          the emphasis on images and colors. I wanted the colors to be friendly
          and fun, and I decided to use two shades of green as the most obvious
          colors. This also matched up with the NSPCA’s current general color
          scheme involving green.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Finding the number of animal images needed for the prototype was, of
          course, a pleasure, but I also realized how much negative space was
          helpful in making the site feel less overwhelming.
        </p>

          <h1>Results & Reflections</h1>
          <p>
            Working with Adobe XD is always a very different experience in
            comparison to Figma. Once I refreshed myself on the learning curve, I
            found that the most time consuming part of making the website was
            actually finding the right accent colors to fit the tone. Initially, I
            had several different color palettes in mind, and deciding which one
            actually fit the feel of the site properly took time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future, I’d like to complete more usability tests. I would
            possibly add an optional section to submitting your details, where you
            can streamline the process at the shelter itself by giving them more
            information ahead of time. This may be more dependent on the shelter,
            however.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe this still strongly modernizes the feeling of a pet shelter
            website and offers helpful features to make sure pets find their
            forever homes.
